# Rust Raylib Example

This codebase is a direct translation of the Raylib example "2D Camera platformer" (at https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) originally written in C++. The purpose of this translation is to demonstrate how to use Raylib with Rust and to explore the capabilities of Rust for game development.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Known Issues

There are currently known bugs in camera 1 and camera 4.
